# Getting Started

Start by reading the [preliminaries](/Documentation~/Preliminaries.md)

There are three separate components included in this package

- [Fracture](/Documentation~/Fracture.md) - Break meshes into pieces during runtime.
- [Prefracture](/Documentation~/Prefracture.md) - Used for pre-fracturing meshes in the editor. The generated fragments can either be saved directly in the scene or saved to disk if you would like to create a prefab.
- [Slice](/Documentation~/Slice.md) - Runtime slicing of meshes
