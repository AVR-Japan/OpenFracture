# Preliminaries

Before using the scripts, there are a few things to be aware of.

1. If you are importing a custom mesh, you must set "Read/Write Enabled" to true in the Import settings. Otherwise you will get an error.
2. Meshes must be be non-intersecting and closed. If not, the re-triangulation will fail.
